One of the cool new things out in the tech world right now is containerization - but what exactly is it and what do I do with it?

Containers have been around in the Linux world for some time now, however, it's only recently that their Windows counterparts got to experience it for themselves. Microsoft released container support with Windows Server 2016 and Windows containers were born.

> This post is for all of you .NET developers who have been working in Windows for so long.

## So what exactly are containers?

Some people refer to containers as mini virtual machines, but I think that brings along some external baggage that causes the analogy to break down. I like to think of containers are the evolution of applications. Applications often require a number of dependencies that they expect to be available for their application to work. One of the dependencies you may be most familiar as Microsoft developers is the .NET runtime. If you wrote an application on the .NET platform and you wanted to give it to a friend to run on their machine, you'd have to make sure that they had the proper version of the .NET Framework/.NET Core runtime installed in order to run the application. If it was a web application, you'd expect to have IIS as a dependency. Even if you package your application in an installer, the installer would still need to install those dependencies.

Now imagine if you gave your friend one big file with all the dependencies already all bundled in. It doesn't matter what they have installed or not installed on their computer - all you need to know is what version of the OS they're running. Do they have .NET Framework installed? Doesn't matter. Do they have IIS? Not my problem. Do they have some weird OS configuration going on? Who cares.

Containers only depend on the kernel of the OS, that is, the core chunk of the operating system that handles the low level instructions of the operating system. This is where stuff like hardware drivers and the like live. Your container OS does need to vaguely match your host OS (Windows is more particular about this) but otherwise it's pretty flexible.

## You haven't said anything about Docker yet.

Docker has become synonymous with containers because Docker has made containers accessible and easy to use. While Docker holds the significant majority (like 80+%) of the container market, there are also other containerization technologies that do similar things such as CoreOS rkt, and Mesos. It's a Kleenex/tissue situation.

## Neat, so how do I get started?

Docker provides a sample hello-world container that you can pull and run by executing the following command:

```bash
```

If you want something more Microsoft and web, Microsoft also has an ASP.NET Core sample application that you can pull and run with the following command:

```bash
```

Congratulations, you just ran your first container!

## Wait, what just happened?

The container you just ran is based on something called Windows Server Nano - a tiny (you might even say "nano") version of Windows Server that depends on the foundational components of Windows to run. This Windows Server Nano image has had ASP.NET Core added to it as well as a basic ASP.NET Core application installed on it. You could have pulled and ran this container image on a brand new computer with just Docker installed on it and it would work. All the dependencies it needs comes along for the ride. Cool, right?
