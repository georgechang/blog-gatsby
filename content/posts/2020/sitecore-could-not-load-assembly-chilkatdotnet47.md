I'm pretty sure the rule is that if you went Googling for an issue and the link that you found the answer on was already purple, you have to blog about it for posterity.

So you just installed Sitecore 9 and after remembering to install IIS and ASP.NET 4.7, you fire up your site to get this wonderful screen.

In this case, the purple link was nothing other than [a page on the Chilkat site itself](https://www.chilkatsoft.com/x64_Framework47.asp).

Hey look, I'm `Common Error #2`! Go install the Visual C++ 2017 runtime. You probably only need the 64-bit.

[Microsoft Visual C++ Runtime 2017 64-bit](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=746572)

[Microsoft Visual C++ Runtime 2017 32-bit](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=746571)

For you cool [Chocolatey](https://chocolatey.org/packages/vcredist2017) command line kids, just do this:

`choco install vcredist2017`
