I had a great time presenting at Virtual SUGCON this past week - while it was disappointing that I wasn't able to present this in Budapest, Hungary for SUGCON EU, I'm glad we had an opportunity to do SUGCON virtually so that so many people around the world could participate!

The presentation was called Meet DEF, Your New BFF and it was about the Sitecore Data Exchange Framework. If you're not familiar with Data Exchange Framework, the recording will show up at some point and you can watch it.

One of the first sections we talked about was the difference between "Data" and "Content", so in a nod to the early 2000's show 8 Simple Rules for Dating My Teenage Daughter, we have 3 Simple Rules for Data in Sitecore. Maybe I'll add 5 more rules at some point to make 8.
